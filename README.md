# SIBI-Sign-Language-Detection-and-Recognition
This is a convolutional neural network project in recognising SIBI sign language. This project experimenting at 8 different model architecture using VGG16 as base architecture. This project use 2 type of testing dataset, sign language gesture with background, and sign language gesture without background.
